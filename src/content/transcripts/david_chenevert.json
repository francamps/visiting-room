I'm incarcerated for 2 counts of second degree murder and I am serving 2 natural life sentences that are running concurrent, so I have 1 life sentence. I've been in front of the pardon board twice in September of 1992 and September of 1995. I was denied for the board's discretion. I've done well since I've been in prison, I've done real well. Coming up through school I was never suspended, never expelled, never had any fights, none of that stuff so jail was new to me."

After a year in Baton Rouge in jail in a one man cell, the jail in Monroe is entirely different, its wide open, I had a couple of fights in jail, but, I've had no fights in Angola, my conduct record is very good."

I was fronting a lot of marijuana and I was fronting it out to other people I guess that's the simplest way to say it. And I was pressured for the money back unexpectedly and I got scared and I ended up stabbing my best friend to death and as well as his girlfriend. The only reason she died, she got in the way.

He gave me a lot of dope to distribute, I distributed it with no hurry on the money back and all the sudden we needed the money back and several months earlier. And I couldn't get it that quick, I had told people other things. As I said I stabbed 2 people to death it was a onetime event. I haven't had any violence in my life like that since."
