Been here for thirty one years."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:00:20-8","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:00:33-5","content":"Where did you grow up?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:00:33-5","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:00:35-7","content":"Well the first nineteen years of my life I grew up in Longview Texas, and then the rest of the time has been here."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:00:35-7","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:00:42-9","content":"And what brought you to Louisiana?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:00:42-9","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:00:46-2","content":"My codefendant. He sought me out from, he was living over in Louisiana in a little town called Minden. And came and sought me out in Longview, told me he had a job that he needed me to help him with, and that turned out to be a lie. But by me having three small babies and no job at the time I figured that it was a good idea for me to come to work and get cash money for the weekend and then go back home and then start my new job the following Tuesday."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:00:46-2","content":"But the job with my codefendant never happened, and a man lost his life because I took part in a crime. And when my codefendant told me what he really wanted to have done I told him I didn't want anything to do with it and he told me if I didn't that he would kill my wife and kids."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:00:46-2","content":"So, being on drugs at the time I thought it was the lesser of two evils to help him do what he was going to do to save my wife and kids. And then I went back home, started my new job that following Tuesday, and was in jail the next night, and haven't been home since."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:00:46-2","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:02:25-1","content":"Is your codefendant serving a life sentence?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:02:25-1","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:02:27-4","content":"Yes he is. And he's, right now he's housed in David Wade Correctional Center on missionary."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:02:27-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:02:37-5","content":"Have you made peace with him?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:02:37-5","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:02:40-6","content":"As far as being civil to him, yes. But I was taught at a young age you keep your friends close and you keep your enemies closer. So, I mean I let him know that we will never be friends but I'm not his enemy. I don't wish any harm to him but uh that God will do what he's got to do and he's going to have to suffer the consequences of his actions. But other than that, I wish him no harm."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:02:40-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:03:18-1","content":"Yeah, it's a strange thing to be serving a life sentence for first degree murder and also be somebody who has never killed anybody."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:03:18-1","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:03:30-7","content":"Right."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:03:30-7","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:03:33-6","content":"Can you tell me a little bit, so let's go back to Texas? Can you tell me a little bit about your family the folks who raised you?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:03:33-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:03:42-3","content":"I was raised by my parents and have three older sisters and we had aâ€¦a good life but not a rich life. I mean dad was always working to make sure we had food on the table and a roof over our head but we didn't want for anything, and everything we needed we always had. And even had money every now and then for vacation, for summer break or something. I mean there was no abuse, or nothing like that. My dad drank a little bit but that was it. No violence."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:03:42-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:04:29-8","content":"Did your mother work outside the home?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:04:29-8","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:04:32-1","content":"She did to an extent, but she was paralyzed from the waist down since before 1960 when my two oldest sisters were born. And she really couldn't do much but she would go and work with my dad cause he had his own business doing, I don't know if you remember them or not but they had gas lights with the mantels and stuff that you had to change."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:04:32-1","content":"Well my dad had his own business and would take care of that kind of stuff and mom would go with him and work. He had a floor business where he would strip floors and re-wax them and stuff and she would go and do what little she could help him with which really wasn't much but she was there supporting him and giving him help."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:04:32-1","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:04:32-1","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:05:24-0","content":"Yeah and I expect that you all, part of your childhood was taking care of the physical needs of your mother."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:05:24-0","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:05:31-3","content":"Right, and I learned at a very early age how to cook for myself because it was difficult for mom to go in the kitchen and cook. Started doing housework around the house when my sisters didn't want to do what they were supposed to and taking care of mom was like a job for me."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:05:57-4","content":"The relationship between your mom and dad was good?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:05:57-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:06:00-6","content":"Yes, even though after I was conceived they never slept in the same bed together, after that. My mom says \"No more\" I was the last one. But other than that, everything was fine."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:06:00-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:06:14-9","content":"Okay, what about close friends outside the home, do you have a couple of people that come to mind that were particularly close with you?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:06:14-9","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:06:25-5","content":"I had a few that I can still to this day call my friends, even though I haven't heard from them in over thirty years. But a friend of mine named Lesley, guy I pretty much grew up with and went to school with but he quit school in the seventh grade, went to work with his dad. But we stayed real close and uh, we got married around the same time and our kids were raised together."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:06:25-5","content":"But then there was a female friend and she moved from California to Longview in the early eighties, and we became real good friends. And used to try to keep me on the right track but I was always rebellious in that area I didn't care who it was, you know, trying to keep me on the right track. I wanted to get high and that's all I cared about."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:06:25-5","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:07:33-9","content":"Let's talk about when did that start?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:07:33-9","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:07:36-2","content":"Getting high? When I was eight, and it steadily progressed after that. I started smoking weed and drinking the little pony bottles of beer when I was eight and by the time I was thirteen, looking back now, I was an alcoholic. I could probably drink mixed drinks with the best of them at thirteen. I shot my first drugs when I was thirteen and it just kept on getting worse."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:07:36-2","content":"And then I end up getting my girlfriend pregnant and we got married, I was seventeen years old. And that's when my life started to change for the better at that point and because I knew that I had to slow down, I had responsibilities. But I didn't give everything up like I should have and you see the results."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:07:36-2","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:08:42-6","content":"Why do you think you started using alcohol and weed at such an early age?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:08:42-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:08:49-5","content":"At first it was just curiosity and then once I found out how it made me feel then it was just because I enjoyed the way it made me feel."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:08:49-5","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:09:02-3","content":"Did your older sisters, did they also have a history of that?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:09:02-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:09:06-0","content":"One of my older sisters, my two older sisters are twins, and one of them used to smoke weed, joints, and the other one didn't. My younger sister, the one that is between me and my older ones, yeah we used to party together all the time. I mean, she and I were real close, and we still are to this day. If there was anyone in my life that was actually my best friend, it was my little sister. See you always call her my little sister because she is my youngest sister."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:09:06-0","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:09:50-0","content":"What's her name?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:09:50-0","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:09:50-8","content":"Melissa."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:09:50-8","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:09:52-6","content":"Does Melissa come and see you?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:09:52-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:09:54-2","content":"Whenever she can save the money and come. Because she lives up about Dallas and it's a good little drive for her to come down here. And most of the time she comes once a year to see me and that's usually around my birthday and it's not going to happen this year but uh she's been having some financial problems and stuff. I told her, I said don't worry about me, said, you take care of yourself, I'm going to be okay."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:09:54-2","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:10:26-3","content":"What about the other two, the twins?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:10:26-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:10:28-3","content":"One lives right outside Longview and the other one now in Pensacola and if they can find somebody to pay for the trip here to come see me then they come see me but they don't have the money to do it on their own."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:10:28-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:10:48-7","content":"So I'm assuming that you didn't finish high school, if you were busy getting married and having babies."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:10:48-7","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:10:54-2","content":"No, I quit in the tenth, well I quit in the eleventh grade. I finished the tenth grade and failed my first trip through eleventh grade and then in '83 I started my second trip through the eleventh grade and uh my dad died and when he went in the hospital I quit school after he went in the hospital because somebody had to be there to make money and bring it in the house."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:10:54-2","content":"And when he died I took that real hard because I had an opportunity to go see him while he was in the hospital but I chose not to because, \"Hey dads going to be home in a week or so I'm not going to go see him in the hospital I'm going to wait until he comes home,\" I regret that. When my uncle come and told us, he pulls up in the yard and I was happy to see him so I come running out of the house and he tells me he says \"Boy, there ain't but one way to tell you this, your dad is dead,\""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:10:54-2","content":"I did an about face run back in the house and put holes all in the wall with my feet and my hands and locked my door, stuck my knife in the door jam, so they couldn't open it, went out the window, and stayed gone for two weeks and nobody knew where I was at. Two days later when they had the funeral I showed up at the funeral and sat beside my mom, never spoke a word."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:10:54-2","content":"When the funeral was over with I left, stayed gone, stayed loaded. And then I came to my senses, come back home told mom I apologize and then I find out that my girlfriends pregnant so another burdenâ€¦turned out to be the best thing that ever happened."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:10:54-2","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:12:58-6","content":"You have three children?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:12:58-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:12:58-6","content":"Three beautiful children."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:12:58-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:13:01-8","content":"Tell me about them."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:13:01-8","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:13:05-1","content":"That part is difficult. My daughter was born first, May 7th, 1984 and my twin sons were born the following June. When I got locked up my twins were eight months old and that was the last time I saw then since. Except in pictures and only a few over the years. I tried to stay in touch with them, I wrote those letters like every week for the first twenty years I was here. And by this time now they're all adults so I figured it's time for me to stop trying it's their choice."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:13:05-1","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:10-3","content":"Do you think they got the letters?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:10-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:11-5","content":"Oh yeah, I know they did. But it's their choice."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:11-5","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:15-8","content":"Did they write you back?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:15-8","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:17-0","content":"Nope, never. But, I mean, I don't hold it against them because I wasn't there and they feel like I abandoned them. I understand that but I mean it's just that's the most difficult part."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:17-0","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:35-4","content":"Oh yeah, I'm sorry."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:35-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:37-4","content":"No that's fine. I mean with me being incarcerated, that to me is the hardest part of it, being away from my kids."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:37-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:54-4","content":"Did you ever get kicked out of school before you quit?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:54-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:57-0","content":"Got suspended a few times for fighting."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:14:57-0","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:59-6","content":"For fighting?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:59-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:15:00-4","content":"Yeah, but most of the time that was just so we could get kicked out of school and have a few days off, go partying. But other than that, no."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:15:00-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:15:12-7","content":"Was there anything about school that you liked?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:15:12-7","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:15:16-4","content":"I actually liked school. I wasn't very good because I was always getting loaded but I liked being in school, liked trying to learn. And it wasn't until later that I realized that I have what I call a retention problem. I can learn stuff but if I push it to the side and get away from it, it's gone my brain won't retain it. And I think that's because of my drug uses and other substances to get high on and I think it burned out part of my brain that does that but I still try."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:15:16-4","content":"And after being clean now for a little over 20 years cause the first 11 years here I was an idiot. I'm starting to be able to keep stuff that I learn."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:15:16-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:16:20-3","content":"When you say getting loaded, what was your drug of choice."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:16:20-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:16:26-9","content":"Well that would be between crystal meth and LSD. But just about anything that I could get my hands on. Other than the only time I ever did heroine was smoked on a joint and didn't like it and did not like cocaine because if I'm going to spend money on something to get high on, it's going to last. Twenty minutes and have to buy more? No. So I never got into cocaine. But crystal meth, LSD, and good weed? Yes."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:16:26-9","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:17:07-1","content":"All of which were pretty easy to get here when you got here?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:17:07-1","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:09-8","content":"Oh yeah. Still is, if you want it, but yeah."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:09-8","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:17:21-4","content":"Do you remember the first time you got arrested?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:17:21-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:24-0","content":"Yes I do. I was thirteen-years-old."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:24-0","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:17:26-3","content":"And what was that about?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:17:26-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:29-1","content":"I had just rolled up on my bicycle to my girlfriend's house and there was a guy that was fifteen-years-old that was trying to rape her. And I chased him out of the house and was running behind him, he got on his bicycle, and I pulled my knife and stabbed the tire, his back tire."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:29-1","content":"And he ended up falling off the bicycle and I beat him up and he took off running and I destroyed his bicycle from where I was at to the back of a Winn-Dixie dumpster and I destroyed the bicycle and threw it in the dumpster."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:29-1","content":"And about fifteen minutes later the police come and got me and charged me with aggravated assault. I was never formally charged but that's what they picked me up on and I ended up having to pay for the kids bicycle and that was it."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:17:29-1","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:18:29-9","content":"And then?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:18:29-9","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:18:31-6","content":"And then when I was fifteen-years-old, in December, early January, December of '81, well no December of '80, January of '81, I went to Ohio with my current codefendant and we got in trouble for breaking into a pharmacy, and a motel room, and somebody's trailer house stealing stuff."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:18:31-6","content":"But the motel we just broke in because we were on our way back to Longview and it was cold, it was winter time, snow was about two-and-a-half-foot deep and we needed a place to stay and didn't want to pay for the motel so we broke in."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:18:31-6","content":"Woke up about two o'clock in the morning with a gun to my head and a whole room full of detectives arresting us. And thought I was going to die because I had an axe handle I was carrying up on the bed on top of the covers with a blue jean jacket with an axe handle, I was curled up around it. And the cop with the gun at my head says, \"Get up out of the bed and hold your hands up\""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:18:31-6","content":"So when I get out, I raise my hands and the axe handle falls to the floor and all you hear is the hammers cocking back on them guns and I just knew I was going to die. I said \"Hold it, hold it, hold it! Its just a stick.\" And then they started laughing. I had a big old bag of weed in my pocket, detective comes over there and gets it, looks at it and stuck it down the front of his pants and I'm thinking to myself, well I just lost that, he wanted it more than I did. But, that was my second time. And then the third time, I was nineteen and it was again right at Christmas time."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:18:31-6","content":"I got arrested for public intoxication and burglary of an apartment. But they dropped the charges on the burglary because I was actually living at the apartment and somebody that wasn't living there tried to press charges. But my little sister made them drop it because they were doing illegal stuff my sister told them \"If my little isn't out by Christmas y'all will be right there in the cell with them.\""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:18:31-6","content":"So they dropped the charges. But I did three days for the public intoxication and that still didn't teach me a lesson."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:18:31-6","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:21:16-4","content":"How did you meet your codefendant?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:21:16-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:21:19-8","content":"Well that's a good one. I was thirteen and he was dating a friend of mines mother and me and my friend was always getting high out behind the house. And my codefendant, he's a few years older than me like probably seven or eight years older than me and he smelled us smoking weed one day, so he comes out, looks and he says, \"You got any more of that?\" Maybe."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:21:19-8","content":"So then we started our conversation and then I started getting weed for him because he didn't know anybody at the time who could get him weed on a regular basis. So, when I started getting the weed for him and everything we started getting closer and just riding around and getting high together and stuff."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:21:19-8","content":"That was a very big mistake but I mean, didn't know at the time, and didn't care at the time. Because when he would give me money I would take the money, I would go and get the weed, take some of his weed out for myself, and then bring his weed back to him. So I got free weed."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:21:19-8","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:15-0","content":"You're thirteen."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:15-0","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:15-3","content":"Oh yeah."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:15-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:19-2","content":"Well I want to talk about, I want to leave that part and I want to talk about the vast majority of your life which has been since then."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:19-2","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:32-3","content":"In here."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:32-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:33-4","content":"Yeah. So I'm sure you spent a bit of time in the parish prison somewhere while you were on trial."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:33-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:40-3","content":"Little over three months. March 6, 1986 is when I got arrested, July 7, '86 I was sitting here. Convicted and sentenced."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:40-3","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:53-9","content":"That was quick."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:53-9","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:55-5","content":"Because I pled guilty."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:22:55-5","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:59-2","content":"I guess one more question about that, did your codefendant plead guilty too?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:22:59-2","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:23:04-5","content":"Right beside me."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:23:04-5","content":""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:05-4","content":"Okay, both of you. So one of the reasons that we wanted to talk with you is because you've been identified by other inmates, security, as being a thoroughly trusted, rehabilitated member of the community. As you know we're trying to shine a light on that and perhaps when we shine a light on folks like yourself it begs the question: does it make sense to keep this guy here until he dies?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:05-4","content":"And that's a part of the project. In thirty years everyone's going to change. Some people change for the better, and some don't. How have you changed? How would you explain the changes that you've gone through to say a parole board or a pardon board."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:05-4","content":""},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:24:03-2","content":"Before I could do that I would have to try to explain how I used to be when I first came here. And when I first got here, I'm nineteen-years-old, I look like I'm fifteen and might weigh 140 pounds. So pretty much everybody here is bigger than I am and of course I'm scared, but I don't want anybody else to know so I've got an attitude I've got a chip on my shoulder which was more like a block. And I just would I guess you would say I would blow up at people, for no reason."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:24:03-2","content":"The second day I was here I got in a fight because I guy had stolen a bar of soap, and then he comes and tells me about it. And I already knew what was taking place, he was wanting to see if somebody else made me do that. To see how I was going to react. If I was going to fight, if I could fight, because that way they would know what they was getting up against if they presented itself to me themselves."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:24:03-2","content":"So I mean when they found out that yes I can and will fight then for two years I didn't have any problems.

And was always getting high, never got busted with drugs. And then in '91, you know what the disciplinary camp is? Camp J."},{"speaker":"Archie","time":"00:24:03-2","content":"Well I went to work over there in the dormitory, I was living in the dormitory working on the tiers and had been over there for four or five days and ordered some hobby craft materials and when they came in I go to the kitchen to eat and as I'm leaving out the doors the security officer says, \"come here let me shake you down\" and all he did was stuck his finger in my pocket and he came out with a joint.
