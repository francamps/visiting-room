I think my change came when I was on lockdown."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:16:04-5","content":"And everybody they had come up with this new rule where if you had been in an aggravated fight on something you had to stay on lockdown for x amount of years until certain people cut you lose. And then I had to really humble myself because I didn't want to be on lockdown so I said I'm about to start following the rules and regulations in order to be among the people in population.

For you was it just you just didn't want to be in lockdown? What was it?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:17:57-0","content":"I think for me for me man. I was going through this situation to where I was contemplating taking my life. I even told I wrote letters to my family and everything I was ready to die. I had had enough I was at a breaking point in my life and a dude came by my cell he must have seen that something was wrong with me he said Simmons have you ever tried God?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:17:57-0","content":"And I said man God ain't going to do anything for me I done too much wrong. I hurt people. I said God ain't gone listen to me. He said Simmons try praying. And I prayed that night and that's probably the most peaceful I've ever slept in this prison. And from that point on life for me has been different."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:17:57-0","content":"That was my change and I think it took God to really change me and I've been different ever since. Able to stay in population able to deal with security while without going off on them and stuff.

I had an attitude where I didn't really care because I never thought I would be able to get I never thought I'd get out of prison."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:19:43-0","content":"Do you think you're going to get out of prison?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:19:45-4","content":"Now? Now I think I have a good opportunity to get out I think I have great opportunity to get out of prison now. The laws is changing things are starting to open up.

So when you look- its 35 years for me that's a lifetime and you were 18 years old. When you look back on the crime and the victims, do you see a sense of proportionality there? Do you feel like you should be serving this much time for this crime?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:22:58-6","content":"Well honestly I mean a person life is taken a person life is taken so there's no really set amount of time that you do when a person life is taken. Because everybody deserve a chance at life and when it's no certain amount of time that I think that you should do. There's no set time because that person deserves life just as much as you do."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:21-0","content":"Ok so how much punishment is enough punishment? For taking a life"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:23:27-6","content":"I don't know. I really can't say. I don't know because a life has value. I couldn't really just put no set time on it I don't know."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:36-8","content":"Have you been punished enough?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:23:38-8","content":"I feel like I have. I feel like 35 years of a man's life should be enough for anything for any type of crime. But it's not my decision. But I feel like I've done more than enough time."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:59-3","content":"Yeah. Do you still feel a sense of remorse about it after all this time?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:24:08-5","content":"Of course of course yes man because I know that they have families loved ones just like I have. And in doing crime and falling into this type of predicament you hurt a lot of people you hurt the victim family you hurt your family everybody there's no winners in a situation like that everybody lose including yourself."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:24:08-5","content":"But every day I think about it I'm out there I live with that I'm' reliving that for the rest of my life and if I can take what I've done and use it to help someone else not make the same decision that I have made I will."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:24:47-7","content":"Was the victim somebody you knew?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:24:50-1","content":"No."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:24:51-2","content":"This is an also a difficult question. When you you've served 35 years when you look at your future now you said you've got hope right? Things may be- and there is movement."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:24:51-2","content":"Especially your youth and how long you've already served for sure. But part of you also must think the way you used to think which is I'm never going to get out of here which is a hopeless feeling."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:25:28-4","content":"Yeah"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:25:28-8","content":"And the concept of life without parole is something I have trouble understanding how I would wrap my head around that. When you do think about the possibility of dying here, how do you cope with that?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:25:46-1","content":"When I think about that."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:25:49-1","content":"There must be times when you think about that?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:25:50-6","content":"I think about that a lot because sometimes that's one of my depressed moments when I'm thinking about if I never get out of here I'm real depressed. And I just pray. I really rely on prayer and ask God not to let me die here."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:25:50-6","content":"That the only way I'm able to cope with it if it wasn't for God I wouldn't even be here today I'd be gone. Because I'd been and took my life what I'm saying cause that's how depressed I get when I go to thinking about that but right now I been real positive I been staying praying for stay and pray I pray a lot I talk to God a lot I know that if anything can happen God can make it happen."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:26:37-9","content":"Ok. And I don't want to make you depressed but I have to ask you that question that's why it's a difficult question so I'm trying to understand this a little bit Edbert so one guy after another is talking about coping with prison by invoking God right? So turning to religion as a way of handling what is otherwise an impossibly difficult situation right?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:26:37-9","content":"Which is- especially when it's so lengthy and so endless. It's different if you get a two year sentence. Do you think people in your situation genuinely believe something or they have no option but to believe it because the other the other choice is impossible?"},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:27:36-4","content":"I think they have no other options. That's their only option. They don't have no other options they don't have anything other to look forward to but to believe and trust in God that's their only option there's nothing else. I mean the doors are closed everywhere else- God is the only way out. And the average person that is serving a life sentence that's all they have. If God don't do it for me it just ain't gone happen."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:28:06-7","content":"And so it's kind of a coping mechanism."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:28:09-0","content":"Yes.

I'm 54 years old now I'm not 18 anymore and I did learn a valuable lesson from then to now. I understand that how to be more mindful of people with the decisions I'm making the things that we do the things that we do can hurt others."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:28:50-1","content":"And I want to be a more positive have more positive effect on people you if I can help any people with my story God knows I would love to help them because I see a lot of children come here and dudes that came here younger than I came here and a lot of them don't really know what they in for."},{"speaker":"Edbert","time":"00:28:50-1","content":"That life mean life in the state of Louisiana and when I be telling them I been here that long they find it hard to believe they don't believe that people be here that long. I didn't' believe that when I first met someone come here and he told me that he been here 33 years and I say man what happened? Because I never thought people be locked up that long and now I find myself in that same position."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:30:08-8","content":"Yeah.

And to give them a chance to open up to listen we listen to what they have to say you and just listening to them what I'm saying it helps them."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:32:55-7","content":"Yeah.
