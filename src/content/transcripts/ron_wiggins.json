Did you get in quite a few fights?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:08:21-7","content":"Yeah that's what everybody did, they'd fight, and nobody shoot.

I can call him when I want, whatever I ask him for, he'll take care of. I feel like, I cheated him by not being in his life.

He have kids too, so he's very active in his kids' lives. He do everything, they do the soccer thing, and they go to Tulane for swimming classes. He's a better man than I can ever be."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:11:04-7","content":"I think it's interesting that you've maintained a relationship with him though. So, he obviously thinks that something is worth- it's worth something to him to have a relationship with you."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:11:21-2","content":"Well, his grandmother, his mom always let him know, it wasn't like I was abusive to him or his mom before prison became my, I always reached out, talked to him, just guide him right."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:11:37-3","content":"Yeah. Do you remember the first time you got arrested?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:11:40-9","content":"First time I got arrested, yeah.

And he walked out the store with a hat. And they arrested both of us. And he was an adult, he was the coach at the park that we used to go to."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:12:05-0","content":"What about after that. What other brushes with the law did you have?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:12:09-7","content":"Like I said, I went to jail for simple robbery, I was 16."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:12:19-0","content":"In the parish?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:12:21-7","content":"No, as a juvenile. City Youth center, maybe 2, 3, months. Robert Gladford was my attorney. My mom got me Robert Glads. Uptown isn't a real crime area, so it looked like every time something happened in the neighborhood I've been arrested for all kind of things. Only been convicted for this."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:12:54-0","content":"Yeah, what lead to that?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:12:59-6","content":"What lead to this? Many altercations I was getting into with people."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:13:04-9","content":"I mean if you had to pinpoint one thing, one reason, that you ended up with this charge what would that be?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:13:14-9","content":"People owing me money."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:13:19-5","content":"Okay, sure. So, were you dealing drugs?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:13:23-3","content":"Yes I was dealing drugs."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:13:28-4","content":"Makes sense. But you said that drugs and alcohol wasn't part of your own life."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:13:35-4","content":"Even then everybody you might not get high but you might have another vice."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:13:48-5","content":"What was your vice?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:13:49-1","content":"Having."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:13:55-4","content":"Sure. Heroin, did that have anything to do with the circumstances of your charge?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:14:07-3","content":"No, I'm arrested for a killing in Jefferson parish, didn't have anything to do with it."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:17-8","content":"Okay, well."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:14:20-6","content":"I ain't say heroin, I mean having. You said what my vice was, I got addicted to having."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:27-7","content":"Oh, I'm sorry, having, you got addicted to having, I heard heroin for some reason. So one of the reasons that we wanted to talk with you and you were identified as somebody to talk with is because you're now considered a model inmate. A trusted member of the community who's turned his life around. How old were you when you were brought through the gates of Angola, do you remember that bus ride?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:14:56-5","content":"23."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:14:56-5","content":"23. Can you describe that person?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:15:02-8","content":"Man, I mean. I was mad, angry because of the circumstances, how I get here. Turning myself in with my lawyer, he told me a bunch of things that wasn't did. I mean I was convicted for killing somebody without a witness, without a gun. I mean, you gone be mad- prison was totally different than it is now. Just a mad person when I got here, they working in the fields all day, crazy."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:15:02-8","content":"I mean I was just angry and mad. Because I'm like man I turned myself in for this, lawyer sold me out, yeah. I was just a mad person, I mean, and through being mad you make bad decisions, even when you get in prison."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:15:58-5","content":"What were your days like when you first came here?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:16:04-1","content":"Just standing, getting aggravated, fighting, and hustling. I got a partner and me that always walk the yard, we always say man what, we took prison the wrong way, we always waiting on lawyers to get something did, and we always talk about Calvin and we always said we should've been in the law library with them guys there. Because you stay in the law library for 30 years sooner or later you going to come up with the key to open the door."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:16:04-1","content":"We became byproducts of the prison. When you become byproducts of prison you study going under. Me and my partner, he's from Lafayette, we always say that. We were young and not thinking, just acting. Thinking lawyers going to take care of this. But they lawyer, he ain't worried about you, he's just getting him money to feed his family. I mean I'm not saying all lawyers, but lawyers I dealt with have."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:17:23-3","content":"If you could go back in time and give that young man some advice, what would you tell him?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:17:36-5","content":"If I could go back in time when you've been in prison for a duration of time you always go back in time in your mind. Something my grandmas always told me, \"Stop doing what you're doing\". I used to be a seamen too, I had a ship like my dad on Warden and Tchoupitoulas. I used to be a marine too. \"Stay on the ship, don't go and get off the ship, stay focused. And nothings worth your freedom, no money in the world's worth your freedom.\""},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:18:11-4","content":"Any advice on how to do time?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:18:15-3","content":"Dang. Doing time, no, it's totally hard. Because, when we came from the gate, it had men here, everybody conducted themself in a man matter, it was more respect here. I mean it's the respect is gone in prison, the thing about doing time now stay focused, stay doing something positive, stay trying to find a way out of here."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:18:15-3","content":"Even when they deny you in courts, stay filling because you're still in here. Stay on top of what's most important for you. Today you got to go around things, the generations are different with guys in prison."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:19:01-2","content":"How is this new generation of young guys?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:19:06-2","content":"Out of control. Because the older guys you can tell us something. You can't tell the young cats nothing because they don't want to listen to advice. I mean my advice would be: look man, put the cell phone down, put the mojo down, or the heroin or whatever drugs you on, get in the law library, and stay focused. Stay focused."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:19:35-0","content":"So, you said you were really mad when you came in, I can understand that."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:19:42-8","content":"Circumstances, how I come to prison. I mean you turn yourself in, the lawyer tells me I'm going to get you out, you go to court, they don't have nobody saying you killed nobody, somebody said you left with him, they come up there you get a life sentence, you like man I always thought you just had somebody point you out and say he the one that did the killing. Yeah, mad, I mean I'm still mad, I just handle it in different ways now. I learned that court did it different."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:20:20-6","content":"But you had already said you had kind of gone down the wrong road anyway. So what lead to you turning your life around once you came to prison? What made you change?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:20:26-8","content":"Because I realized I was trying to fit in somewhere that wasn't me. It's like anything else. You never know people until you get in a place with people. And then when you get in an abnormal environment like this you say \"Man this not me, I was just a person trying to fit in, this ain't me. I'm not even this dude\". I think some dudes breaded for prison, made for prison. I think some prison made for some people."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:21:01-2","content":"How long into your 31 years now, how long into that."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:21:03-9","content":"1997."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:21:05-9","content":"So can you something specific."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:21:09-8","content":"Prison changed. So when prison changed, you have to change. So, all the madness and the fooling I was doing I said what I'm saying, I got to just stay focused."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:21:21-5","content":"But what lead you to that, why didn't you get to that point earlier? Here's where I'm going with this Ron, sometimes people just make a decision they're going to change their life around because maybe from a mentor or sometimes it's through a spiritual awakening or something, sometimes its real gradual, you just kind of age out."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:21:46-3","content":"Now that you saying that, I think I'm more in touch with God than I've ever been; and the greatest part about that because I come up with my mom, which is my grandmother, she went to church every Sunday. I come up in a house with God, but I'm more in touch with God now than I've ever been than when I was 23, 24, 25, 26, and 30. I'm more spiritual now than I ever was. I think God touched me in a lot of ways that I know I'm not a bad person because they got a lot of guys that left here that I did a lot of good things for while they was here."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:21:46-3","content":"They actually come back to see me, actually help me pay lawyers and they actually do things for me right now. My son be like I got you dad. So I put people on the right track. That partner of mine's name is Jones he brothers, he was in reentry up here. I used to just tell him \"Man, stay from behind the building, stay focused, you gone get out\". He came to see me a few weeks ago and he brother brings him up here he buying a house in New Orleans east. He's well, I wouldn't be where I'm at. So I helped people."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:10-5","content":"Sure. But what lead you to turn that around?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:23:14-7","content":"I feel like if you helped one person you did well."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:23:26-3","content":"Yeah I agree. But I'm trying to understand more about 1997."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:23:33-2","content":"I stayed locked up for 3 years for a guy. In the 3 years I stayed locked up I stayed in the cell, then when I was in the cell I had altercations with guys. Getting aggravated and fighting in the cell. Then in 1997 when I realized man these dudes ain't is crap. Back away, stay focused, get out. What I'm saying, stop depending on lawyers."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:24:04-1","content":"What's your typical day now?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:24:12-0","content":"Well, I work in the administration building, where y'all come through at, at the front. I go to work 12 hours a day. I read books, I eat meals all day. I just work and I just stay busy."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:24:29-3","content":"What's your job in the building?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:24:31-2","content":"Orderly. Clean up, cook eggs, and fix coffee, whatever needed. Then they got a few young guys. A lot of guys that have been here from New Orleans, so I know they people. When I catch them I try to tell them right from wrong, if they listen it's cool if not I keep going."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:24:51-2","content":"Yeah. Are there some organizations that you're part of here at Angola?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:24:54-5","content":"No, but I got a certificate from a lot of organizations that I've been a part of."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:25:01-2","content":"Yeah, tell me a little bit about that."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:25:06-3","content":"Like concept back then with Buck Buck years ago at camp C. I did the thing. I mean, AIDS awareness."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:25:27-5","content":"Have you taken advantage of any of the vocational training that Angola has now?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:25:29-6","content":"No."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:25:31-2","content":"I know it's hard if you're serving a life sentence to get into those things."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:25:34-6","content":"I always feel if I can ever get out of prison and I was in good health. I can always go back on the ship because, I couldn't get my passport to go nowhere until I get my citizenship back, but I can always go back on the ship. I still got my Z card."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:25:59-5","content":"I don't want to dwell on the crime, that's not why we're here to talk. But you've been punished for 31 years now."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:26:01-9","content":"Right."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:26:10-1","content":"How much punishment is enough?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:26:12-2","content":"I always ask myself that. But even now when I look at the Life channel. Here they got different states that people commit crimes, the same type of crimes that we're charged for, convicted for, and they get 25 years. And here we doing 30 years, like Kansas and St Louis when you look at the life channel, they tell you after how much time a person got for killing somebody or whatever."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:26:12-2","content":"And that's what I'm saying, this state is an unmerciful state. I've been here 31 years, they got guys at camp that was here 25 years before I got here. This state is an unforgiving state. That's a good question, when is enough?"},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:27:04-0","content":"When you look back whenever I explain what we're doing with this project. I think a very fair question that people will say to me is: well wait a minute, what about the victim? They didn't get a second chance, what are you talking about."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:27:24-1","content":"I feel like when you say about the victim, I feel like the average person here with a life sentence for killing somebody they can put breath back in the body, but it's the circumstances you say look at the victim. Okay, besides this state and 2 other states, they got the victim in every state you can never give a person they life back. I mean, it's just too much time they give here. You going to keep a man all this time just put him in front of a firing squad and kill him, shoot him, stop him from suffering."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:28:03-3","content":"When you look back on your crime, and the victim's family, was it somebody you knew?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:28:13-9","content":"Miguel that I'm arrested for I knew him. He, they not even from this country."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:28:22-2","content":"So this is a difficult question to ask you guys. But we have to talk about it. Even when there's hope that something may change, I'm sure that you've confronted the fact that you may never get out of here. You may die here. How do you cope with that?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:28:51-7","content":"I think, like, not just me. I think the thing that's keeping the population going now, like the thing with the 40 year lifers, guys been there 40 years and they just got that. I think that dudes like me with a life sentence with no parole no benefit to die here, I think that keep us going that one day that something change for us. I mean because not just that, that's not a difficult question because if we didn't have hope, you think we can get up and go to work every day. And some days be harder than others."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:29:30-0","content":"Do you see guys just kind of give up and accept the fact that they're just not going to get out?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:29:34-7","content":"I think the younger guys is more like \"I don't give a damn\", than the older guys. You got to understand this, a lot of older guys died off, some, half the guys I was here with they not even here no more. When guys were in the law library, they was trying to get guys out of here. You don't see them with the same people in the law library. I don't even think the young guys worried about getting out."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:29:34-7","content":"I mean you can die at any age. But I feel like the governor did something new about it since I been confined. That's the hope that keep the older guys like me here hoping this governor do the right thing and change some laws even when they say parole for life, that don't mean you going to make parole, that just mean you can go on the parole board."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:30:38-8","content":"Yeah, it's not a get out of jail free card."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:30:40-7","content":"So, when you saying like, when death call it's going to call, ne certain age, no rich man no poor man, death going to get you. So I don't, the hope keep us going. That's why I touched the spiritual part of my life cause a guy told me the other day, a good friend of mine that helped me pay lawyers, he said \"Man, I can pay any lawyer you want, but when God open the doors for humanity they not going to be able to stop it\" That stuck in my mind."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:30:40-7","content":"I mean God got you here, you don't have to be here. This is something that 20 years ago when you're career first started you never thought you'd be in Angola doing this. So, what I'm saying, I don't, God said even if it don't work, God still have you on because you got the heart to say that's just too long, 37 years. You can go to camp F and ask guys \"How long you been in jail?\", \"Since '61, '62\" That's why I say I'm getting like the spiritual part of things. Because you don't have to come here."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:31:56-2","content":"Yeah the oldest guy we talked with was Sammy Robinson."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:32:01-3","content":"And he come from reform school here.

They come here, one of them had 15 years, and one of them had 40 years. They kill a guy here. And when they kill a guy here, they had no hope for getting out. They went and got life in saint from killing a guy here."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:32:11-7","content":"They give him a 40 year life. So now they're on their way out, so you never know. You got to say focused when if something do happen you'll be in the right position for that. Now these guys had no hope, but they bout to go home. Because that ain't man, that's God touching that. I'm just showing you."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:32:54-7","content":"I agree."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:32:56-9","content":"I'm walking the yard in 1980, I said \"Bill what's wrong?\" He crying, I never saw a grown man cry. He said, \"Man you know what the day is? I said \"What?\" He said \"The day of my 40 year I discharge\" His brother had 50 he been discharged. That was 1989 and now its 2017. Because of guys like Norris, guys like Calvin, we going to fight, do the right thing. We just ask them to do the right thing. Because I wouldn't even want a man to come out who's not ready for the street."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:33:29-5","content":"Right. Angola's definitely changed since you've been here. I mean everybody's talking about that for sure. What, for you, is the worst part of this prison?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:33:48-7","content":"Worst part of this prison. I mean, my worst thing is just waking up in the morning, just being here. I mean, everything. When you get older your view become, everything really going to get on your nerves when you get older the food going to get on your nerves, the young inmates going to get on your nerves. Not to the point where you going to do anything about or nothing, you just get mad, this what I sold my soul for, this what I'm settling for. I don't know."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:34:26-5","content":"Yeah, it's probably a silly question. I mean the worst thing about being in prison is prison."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:34:35-5","content":"You looking at like, you be here so long, everybody going to die. Your mama going to die if you got a mama, your daddy going to die if you got a daddy, your brothers, sisters, you be here so long. Love is priceless, and when you come to prison, you hurt a lot of people. You send your people somewhere in chains to come and see you."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:34:35-5","content":"They not criminals but they got to go before dawn, they got to go in a metal detector, none of my people criminals. They worked they whole life. Another hurting part is I can't see my grandchildren. I understand, my son don't want his kids coming through that. He'll bring them. He don't want them in the little machine.

If you had to find something good to say about Angola, what would be the best part about this place?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:35:58-6","content":"I would tell the dude that just come in prison they should thank God for people like Warden Bernard. Because, before his term, he does everything humanly possible to help them get out of here."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:36:25-7","content":"That's good. You'd mentioned, that you feel good for having helped some people, through the reentry program. If you look back on everything you've done in your life. What stands out as something that you're most proud of?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:36:43-1","content":"I've helped a few people get outta here. And guys in reentry they just took my advice. Another friend of mine, I helped him, he stayed in literacy school like 10 years. Russell, he's doing his own landscaping thing, got his business going. When you can help others and can't help yourself, that's tight."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:37:10-4","content":"Yeah. What are your goals for the future?"},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:37:16-1","content":"I mean, I'll be 54 this year, so I understand if I can get out right now today I'll go back on the ship, my niece she got a chicken business.

And that's it."},{"speaker":"Marcus","time":"00:38:56-2","content":"Sure, fair enough. It's been very valuable to talk with you and to hear what you have to say already a lot. But if there's something that I should've asked you about your experience that I didn't and I didn't give you an opportunity to talk about that you wanted to."},{"speaker":"Ron","time":"00:39:19-1","content":"Basically you asked everything.
