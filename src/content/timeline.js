            and control formerly enslaved people and compel them into years of 
            involuntary servitude. Southern states passed sweeping vagrancy and labor 
            contract laws and adopted penal codes that subjected Black people to 
            prosecution for "offenses", such as disobeying curfew, loitering, and not 
            carrying proof of employment. Often guilty of no crime at all, 
            Black people were arrested and forced to labor in the state’s penal system – 
            all of whom could be leased for profit to large plantations, coal mines, 
            railways and lumber companies. Prisons were basically forced labor camps, 
            ensuring continued economic production and profits for state governments 
            and private enterprise, while prisoners earned no pay and suffered terrible and inhumane conditions.
