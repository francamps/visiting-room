          The use of life without parole developed differently 
          in each state according to a confluence of local factors, 
          state politics, and national trends (with the exception of Alaska, 
          which has never adopted the sentence). 
          By way of example, here is a summary of the origins of life 
          without parole in Louisiana, compiled in large part 
          from the meticulously researched, contemporaneous accounts 
          of writers at Angola’s prison newspaper, The Angolite.
