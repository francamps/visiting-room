              A History of Life Without Parole in Louisiana
            </h2>
            <p>
              Life without parole - a sentence to die in prison without any
              possibility of release - is a largely American phenomenon. The
              United States accounts for more than 80% of these sentences
              worldwide. Louisiana has the highest proportion (15%) of its
              incarcerated population serving life without parole of any state
              in the country, while Pennsylvania has the highest number. The
              extent to which other states use the sentence depends on a
              confluence of local factors, state politics, and national trends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is a summary of the origins of life without parole in
              Louisiana, compiled in large part from the meticulously
              researched, contemporaneous accounts of writers at Angolaâ€™s prison
              newspaper, The Angolite.
